# Building a website with Express.js and Node.js 

This project was forked from a [Linkedin Learn course](https://github.com/danielkhan/building-website-nodejs-express).

> A simple meet-up page with speaker info and feedback, that is dynamic end-to-end.


## General Information
The project was created as a first step to understanding Express.js. With an understanding of node.js, I was eager to build something on top of it and found this course online. I tried to replicate the app creation that the instructor walks us through. It is a simple app which simulates a meetup website with speaker pages and a feedback page. The site uses dynamic views.



## Features

- Index and sub-pages(list page and individual speaker pages) -> implemented with Express routes and EJS templating engine. 
- Fetch and render speaker info and feedback  -> using async/await
- Persist data between sessions -> using session management middleware
- Feedback form - Handling POST request, using 'body-parser' and other libraries to validate and sanitize user input.
- Update of feedback form without full page refresh - by storing and fetching from JSON files and creating API endpoints and client-side JS.
